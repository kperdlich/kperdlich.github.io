Hi! I'm Kevin Perdlich, a generalist software developer / programmer from Hamburg, Germany. 
I've been in the industry for many years having worked with C#, C++, Java, Kotlin, AS3, JS, TS on a variety of fields including Mobile/Desktop/Web Apps, Backend and Service development, SDK's and Video Games. 
I enjoy hacking on different projects and technologies. :)
